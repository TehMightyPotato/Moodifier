# PnP.Moodifier

Set the mood with music while playing your favourite tabletop RPG

## State of the Project

I initially planned on developing this further to use for the ttrpg sessions I host. I since switched to using [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), which supports playing music natively. This made my time investment in this obsolete. I will leave this up as an archive, but I won't continue development, sorry.

## Usage
As it is right now, this is a very WIP implementation of a web music player using blazor server. To run it you currently have to run it manually with `dotnet run`.
